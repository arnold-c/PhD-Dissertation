    === Background
    Infectious disease surveillance and outbreak detection systems often utilize diagnostic testing to validate case identification. The metrics of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value are commonly discussed when evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests, and to a lesser degree, the performance of outbreak detection systems. However, the interaction of the two levels’ (the test and the alert system) metrics, is typically overlooked. Here, we describe how equivalent regions of detection accuracy can exist over a range of diagnostic test characteristics, examining the sensitivity to background noise structure and magnitude.

    === Methods
    We generated a stochastic SEIR model with importation to simulate true measles and non-measles sources of febrile rash (noise) daily incidence. We generated time series of febrile rash (i.e., measles clinical case definition) by summing the daily incidence of measles and either independent Poisson noise or non-measles dynamical noise (consistent with rubella virus). For each time series we assumed a fraction of all cases were seen at a healthcare clinic, and a subset of those were diagnostically confirmed using a test with sensitivity and specificity consistent with either a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or perfect diagnostic test. From the resulting time series of test-positive cases, we define an outbreak alert as the exceedance of a threshold by the 7-day rolling average of observed (test positive) cases. For each threshold level, we calculated percentages of alerts that were aligned with an outbreak (analogous to the positive predictive value), the percentage of outbreaks detected (analogous to the sensitivity), and combined these two measures into an accuracy metric for outbreak detection. We selected the optimal threshold as the value that maximizes accuracy. We show how the optimal threshold and resulting accuracy depend on the diagnostic test, testing rate, and the type and magnitude of the non-measles noise.

    === Results
    The optimal threshold for each test increased monotonically as the percentage of clinic visits who were tested increased. With Poisson-only noise, similar outbreak detection accuracies could be achieved with imperfect RDT-like tests as with perfect diagnostic tests (c. 93%), given moderately high testing rates. With larger delays (14 days) between the perfect test administration and result date, RDTs could outperform the perfect tests. Similar numbers of unavoidable cases and outbreak alert delays could be achieved between the test types. With dynamical noise, however, the accuracy of perfect test scenarios was far superior to those achieved with RDTs (c.~93% vs.~73%). For dynamical noise, RDT-based scenarios typically favored more sensitive alert threshold than perfect test based scenarios (at a given testing rate), observed with lower numbers of unavoidable cases and detection delays.

    === Conclusions
    The performance of an outbreak detection system is highly sensitive to the structure and the magnitude of background noise. Under the assumption that the noise is relatively static over time, RDTs can perform as well as perfect tests in a surveillance system. However, when the noise is temporally correlated, as from a separate SEIR process, imperfect tests cannot overcome their accuracy limitations through higher testing rates.

== Background

Diagnostics are medical devices and techniques used to detect the presence of a specific pathogen in a host @DiagnosticsGlobal.
This may include #emph[in vivo] measures, such as x-ray imagery, or #emph[in vitro] tests to directly quantify the presence of the pathogen itself, e.g. polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or the host's response to the pathogen e.g., enzyme immunoassay/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA/ELISA) @DiagnosticsGlobal @yangPCRbasedDiagnosticsInfectious2004 @alhajjEnzymeLinkedImmunosorbent2024.
Any given diagnostic will vary in its ability to correctly identify the presence of the pathogen, which is described by its sensitivity and specificity.
The sensitivity of a diagnostic is the ability to correctly identify a positive result, conditional on a positive individual being tested i.e., a true positive result @westreichDiagnosticTestingScreening2019 @shrefflerDiagnosticTestingAccuracy2024 @parikhUnderstandingUsingSensitivity2008.
The specificity is the opposite: the ability to correctly determine a true negative result, conditional on a negative individual being tested @westreichDiagnosticTestingScreening2019 @shrefflerDiagnosticTestingAccuracy2024 @parikhUnderstandingUsingSensitivity2008.
Due to the translation of quantitative measures e.g., immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titers, into a binary outcomes (positive/negative), the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic are often at odds with one another.
For example, using a low optical density value to define the threshold for detection for an ELISA will produce a diagnostic that is highly sensitive, as it only requires a small host response to the pathogen and many resulting antibody titers will exceed this value.
However, this may lead to low specificity due to an increase in spurious false positive results from non-infected individuals.
To account for these differences, the target product profile (TPP) of a diagnostic provides a minimum set of characteristics that should be met, helping to guide the development and use @worldhealthorganizationTargetProductProfiles.

The choice to prioritize sensitivity or specificity will be pathogen and context specific.
When the cost of a false negative result is disproportionately high relative to a false positive, such as for Ebola @chuaCaseImprovedDiagnostic2015, highly specific tests are required.
This balance will, however, vary as the prevalence of infection in a population varies.
Higher presence of infection in a population will increase the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test i.e., the probability that a positive test reflects a positive individual, that unlike the sensitivity of the test, is not conditioned upon the infection status of the tested individual @westreichDiagnosticTestingScreening2019 @shrefflerDiagnosticTestingAccuracy2024.
Regions of high disease burden may therefore prioritize test sensitivity, in contrast to a lower burden location's preference for test specificity, all else being equal.

At the heart of an outbreak detection system is a surveillance program that enumerates the baseline rate of case incidence and defines an outbreak as a time period with anomalously high incidence relative to that baseline @murrayInfectiousDiseaseSurveillance2017 @zhouEliminationTropicalDisease2013 @pahoIntegratedApproachCommunicable2000 @craggOutbreakResponse2018.
As many disease symptoms reflect generic host responses to infection e.g., febrile rash, and infection with a given pathogen can give rise to a wide range of disease symptoms and severity across individuals, accurate methods of case identification are required.
Given the imperfect nature of diagnostic classification, any result for an individual is uncertain.
Accumulating multiple individual test results to produce population-level counts will propagate this uncertainty, and may result in over- or under-counts due to a preponderance of false positive and negative individual test results, respectively.
This process becomes increasingly important when the prevalence of the surveillance program's target disease is low relative to the presence of other sources of clinically-compatible cases; the PPV of an individual diagnostic decreases, increasing the number of false positives, making it harder to distinguish true anomalies in disease incidence.
As a result, it has been commonplace for surveillance systems to be developed around high-accuracy tests, such as PCR and ELISA tests, when financially and logistically feasible @gastanaduyMeasles2019 @commissionerCoronavirusCOVID19Update2020@grasslyComparisonMolecularTesting2020@ezhilanSARSCoVMERSCoVSARSCoV22021 @worldhealthorganizationCholera2023 @essentialprogrammeonimmunizationepiimmunizationClinicalSpecimensLaboratory2018.

Outbreak detection systems face the same issue regarding the prioritization of sensitive or specific alerts @germanSensitivityPredictiveValue2000@worldhealthorganizationOperationalThresholds2014 @lewisTimelyDetectionMeningococcal2001.
For many disease systems, particularly in resource constrained environments where the burden of infectious diseases is typically highest @gbd2019childandadolescentcommunicablediseasecollaboratorsUnfinishedAgendaCommunicable2023 @roserBurdenDisease2023, cases are counted and if a pre-determined threshold is breached, be that weekly, monthly, or some combination of the two, an alert is triggered that may launch a further investigation and/or a response @worldhealthorganizationMeaslesOutbreakGuide2022 @worldhealthorganizationOperationalThresholds2014.
In effect, this discretizes a distinctly continuous phenomenon (observed cases) into a binary measure (outbreak or no outbreak) for decision making purposes.
For reactive management approaches, such as vaccination campaigns and non-pharmaceutical based interventions that are designed to reduce transmission or limit and suppress outbreaks, early action has the potential to avert the most cases @atkinsAnticipatingFutureLearning2020@taoLogisticalConstraintsLead @graisTimeEssenceExploring2008 @ferrariTimeStillEssence2014 @worldhealthorganizationConfirmingInvestigatingManaging2009 @minettiLessonsChallengesMeasles2013.
While this framing would point towards a sensitive (i.e., early alert) surveillance system being optimal, each action comes with both direct and indirect financial and opportunity costs stemming from unnecessary activities that limit resource availability for future responses.
Much like the need to carefully evaluate the balance of an individual diagnostic test's sensitivity and specificity, it is essential to consider at the outbreak level.

The concept of using incidence-based alert triggers to detect the discrete event of an outbreak with characteristics analogous to individual tests has been well documented in the case of meningitis, measles, and malaria @worldhealthorganizationMeaslesOutbreakGuide2022 @lewisTimelyDetectionMeningococcal2001 @worldhealthorganizationConfirmingInvestigatingManaging2009 @trotterResponseThresholdsEpidemic2015 @cooperReactiveVaccinationControl2019 @zalwangoEvaluationMalariaOutbreak2024 @kanindaEffectivenessIncidenceThresholds2000.
However, an overlooked, yet critical, aspect of an outbreak detection system is the interplay between the individual test and outbreak alert characteristics.
With their success within malaria surveillance systems, and particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have garnered wider acceptance, and their potential for use in other disease systems has been gaining interest @warrenerEvaluationRapidDiagnostic2023.
Despite concerns of their lower diagnostic accuracy slowing their adoption until recently @millerAddressingBarriersDevelopment2015, the reduced cold-chain requirements @brownRapidDiagnosticTests2020, reduced training and laboratory requirements and costs @essentialprogrammeonimmunizationepiimmunizationClinicalSpecimensLaboratory2018 @worldhealthorganizationMeaslesOutbreakGuide2022 @brownRapidDiagnosticTests2020, and faster speed of result provided by RDTs has been show to outweigh the cost of false positive/negative results in some settings @warrenerEvaluationRapidDiagnostic2023 @mcmorrowMalariaRapidDiagnostic2011 @larremoreTestSensitivitySecondary2021 @middletonModelingTransmissionMitigation2024.


In this paper, we examine how the use of imperfect diagnostic tests affects the performance of outbreak detection in the context of measles where RDTs are being developed with promising results @20240613_tpp_measles_rubell_FV_EN @brownRapidDiagnosticTests2020 @warrenerEvaluationRapidDiagnostic2023 @shonhaiInvestigationMeaslesOutbreak2015 (though not exclusively @seninMeaslesIgMRapid2024).
We evaluate the scenarios under which equivalence in outbreak detection can be achieved, where altering testing rates can offset the reduction in diagnostic discrimination of imperfect tests relative to perfect tests, and meaningful improvements can be attained with respect to specific metrics e.g., speed of response.
By examining the combination of the alert threshold and individual test characteristics in a modeling study that explicitly incorporates dynamical background noise, we illustrate the need to develop TPPs for surveillance programs as a whole.


== Methods
=== Model Structure
We constructed a stochastic compartmental non-age structured Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model of measles, and simulated using a modified Tau-leaping algorithm with a time step of 1 day @gillespieApproximateAcceleratedStochastic2001.
We utilized binomial draws to ensure compartment sizes remained positive valued @chatterjeeBinomialDistributionBased2005.
We assumed that the transmission rate ($beta_t$) is sinusoidal with a period of one year and 20% seasonal amplitude.
$R_0$ was set to 16, with a latent period of 10 days and infectious period of 8 days @guerraBasicReproductionNumber2017 @gastanaduyMeasles2019.
The population was initialized with 500,000 individuals with Ghana-like birth and vaccination rates, and the final results were scaled up to the approximate 2022 population size of Ghana (33 million) @worldbankGhana.
Ghana was chosen to reflect a setting with a high-performing measles vaccination program that has not yet achieved elimination status (c. 80% coverage for two doses of measles-containing vaccine), and must remain vigilant to outbreaks @WHOImmunizationData @masreshaTrackingMeaslesRubella2024.
We assumed commuter-style imports at each time step to avoid extinction; the number of imports each day were drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean proportional to the size of the population and $R_0$ @keelingModelingInfectiousDiseases2008.
The full table of parameters can be found in @tbl_od-model-parameters.

<tbl_od-model-parameters>

To examine the sensitivity of the detection system to background noise, we generated a time series of symptomatic febrile rash by combining the measles incidence time series with a noise time series.
The noise time series was modeled as either Poisson-only noise, to represent the incidence of non-specific febrile rash due to any of a number of possible etiologies, or dynamical noise modeled as a rubella SEIR process.
For Poisson-only noise, the time series of non-measles febrile rash cases each day was constructed by independent draws from a Poisson distribution.
For dynamical noise, we generated time series of cases from an SEIR model that matched the measles model in structure, but had $R_0 = 5$, mean latent period of 7 days, and mean infectious period of 14 days.
We also added additional Poisson noise with mean equal to 15% of the average daily rubella incidence to account for non-rubella sources of febrile rash (@tbl_od-model-parameters) @papadopoulosEstimatesBasicReproduction2022 @RubellaCDCYellow.
The seasonality for the rubella noise was simulated to be in-phase with measles.

For each noise structure, we simulated five magnitudes of noise ($Lambda$), representing the average daily noise incidence.
$Lambda$ was calculated as a multiple ($c$) of the average daily measles incidence ($angle.l Delta I_M angle.r$): $Lambda = c dot.op angle.l Delta I_M angle.r upright("where") c in { 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 }$.
Noise magnitudes will be denoted as $Lambda (c)$ for the rest of the manuscript e.g., $Lambda (8)$ to denote scenarios where the average noise incidence is 8 times that of the average measles incidence.
For the Poisson-noise scenarios, independent draws from a Poisson distribution with mean $c dot.op angle.l Delta I_M angle.r$ were simulated to produce the noise time series i.e., $Lambda (c) = upright("Pois")(c dot.op angle.l Delta I_M angle.r)$.
For the dynamical noise scenarios, the rubella vaccination rate at birth was set to 85.38%, 73.83%, 50.88%, 27.89%, or 4.92% to produce equivalent values of $Lambda$ (to within 2 decimal places): $Lambda (c) = angle.l Delta I_R angle.r + upright("Pois")(0.15 dot.op angle.l Delta I_R angle.r)$.
We simulated 100 time series of 100 years for each scenario, before summarizing the distributions of outbreak detection methods.

=== Defining Outbreaks
It is common to use expert review to define outbreaks when examining empirical data, but this is not feasible in a modeling study where tens of thousands of years are being simulated.
Previous simulation studies define an outbreak as a period where $R_"t" > 1$ with the aim of detecting an outbreak during the grow period @jombartRealtimeMonitoringCOVID192021 @stolermanUsingDigitalTraces2023, or use a threshold of > 2 standard deviations (s.d.) over the mean seasonal incidence observed in empirical data (or from a 'burn-in' period of the simulation) @sternAutomatedOutbreakDetection1999 @salmonMonitoringCountTime2016 @teklehaimanotAlertThresholdAlgorithms2004 @leclereAutomatedDetectionHospital2017.

Here we simulate time series of 100 years and we define a measles outbreak as a region of the time series that meets the following three criteria:

- The daily measles incidence must be greater than, or equal to, 5 cases
- The daily measles incidence must remain above 5 cases for greater than, or equal to, 30 consecutive days
- The total measles incidence must be great than, or equal to, 500 cases within the bounds of the outbreak

Only events meeting all 3 criteria are classified as outbreaks.
The incidence of non-measles febrile rash (i.e., noise) does not affect the outbreak status of a region but may affect the alert status triggered by the testing protocol.

Each day, 60% of the measles and non-measles febrile rash cases visit the clinic for treatment, and a percentage (P) of these clinic visits are tested; all clinic visits are deemed to be suspected measles cases because they meet the clinical case definition.
The percentage of clinic visits (P) that are tested is varied between 10% and 60%, in 10% increments.
Each "testing scenario" combines a testing rate (P) with one of the following tests:

- An imperfect test with 85% sensitivity and specificity, and 0-day lag in result return. That is, 85% of true measles cases will be correctly labelled as positive, and 15% of non-measles febrile rash individuals that are tested will be incorrectly labelled as positive for measles. This acts as a lower bound of acceptability for a hypothetical measles RDT @20240613_tpp_measles_rubell_FV_EN
- An imperfect test with 90% sensitivity and specificity, and 0-day lag in result return @brownRapidDiagnosticTests2020
- A perfect test with 100% sensitivity and specificity, and a 0-day test result delay. This is more accurate than is observed for current ELISA tests @hiebertEvaluationDiagnosticAccuracy2021, but it used to evaluate the theoretical best-case scenario
- A perfect test with 100% sensitivity and specificity, and a 14-day test result delay

For each time series of true measles cases, we define outbreaks as the range of time that meets the definition above (@fig-outbreak-schematic a).
We then add non-measles noise (@fig-outbreak-schematic b) and test according to the testing scenario, which yields 5 time series of test-positive cases (@fig-outbreak-schematic c): one time series of all clinically compatible cases and 4 reflecting the testing scenarios.

In panel C, the dark blue bands represent regions of the test positive time series that breach the alert threshold (the horizontal dashed line), and constitute an alert.
    ]
)
<fig-outbreak-schematic>

=== Triggering Alerts
We define an "alert" as any consecutive string of 1 or more days where the 7-day moving average of the test-positive cases is greater than, or equal to, a pre-specified alert threshold, T.
For each time series of test-positive cases, we calculate the percentage of alerts that are "correct", defined as any overlap of 1 or more days between the alert and outbreak periods (@fig-outbreak-schematic a and c).
This is analogous to the PPV of the alert system, and will be referred to as such for the rest of the manuscript.
Note that it is possible to have multiple alerts within a single outbreak if the 7-day moving average of test positive cases drops below the threshold, T, and we count each as correct.
For all outbreaks in the measles time series, we calculate the percentage that contain at least 1 alert within the outbreak’s start and end dates (@fig-outbreak-schematic a and c).
We refer to this as the sensitivity of the alert system.
We also calculate the detection delay as the time from the start of an outbreak to the start of its first alert.
If the alert period starts before the outbreak and continues past the start date of the outbreak, this would be considered a correct alert with a negative delay i.e., an early warning triggered by false positive test results.
Finally, for each time series we calculate the number of unavoidable and avoidable outbreak cases.
Unavoidable cases are those that occur before a correct alert, or those that occur in an undetected outbreak.
Avoidable cases are defined as those that occur within an outbreak after a correct alert is first triggered i.e., cases that could theoretically be prevented with a perfectly effective and timely response.
Not all cases defined as avoidable would be in practice (due to imperfect and delays in responses); the specifics of operation response are beyond the scope of this work.

We define the accuracy of the surveillance system for a given time series as the mean of the system’s PPV and sensitivity.
To examine the interaction of the test with the surveillance system's characteristics (i.e., testing rate, noise structure and magnitude), we varied the alert threshold, T, between 1 and 15 cases per day.
Each of the 100 simulations per scenario produces an accuracy, and we identified the optimal alert threshold, T#sub([O]), as the value that produced the highest median accuracy for a given scenario.
We then compare testing scenarios at their respective optimal alert threshold.
This allows for conclusions to be made about the surveillance system as a whole, rather than just single components.

== Results
The threshold that maximized surveillance accuracy depends on diagnostic test characteristics, the testing rate, and the structure of the non-measles noise (@tbl_od-optimal-thresholds).
When the average noise incidence was 8 times higher than the average measles incidence ($Lambda (8)$), the optimal threshold ranged between 1 and 7 test-positive cases per day.
Not surprisingly, the biggest driver of this difference was the testing rate; as a larger fraction of suspected cases are tested, the optimal threshold increases monotonically for all test and noise types (@tbl_od-optimal-thresholds).

The maximal attainable surveillance accuracy at the optimal threshold depends strongly on the structure and magnitude of the background noise.
For Poisson noise, at all magnitudes, the maximum surveillance accuracy increases rapidly from 65% at 10% testing of suspected clinic cases, to $approx$ 90% accuracy at $gt.eq$ 20% testing, for all test types (@fig-accuracy).
For dynamical SEIR noise, the perfect tests perform identically to the Poisson noise case at all magnitudes (@fig-accuracy).
For imperfect diagnostic tests, which have lower individual sensitivity and specificity, the maximal attainable accuracy is lower than the perfect tests for all testing rates (P) at noise magnitude $gt.eq Lambda (2)$ (@fig-accuracy).
Notably, the surveillance accuracy declines with increasing noise and, at all noise levels, is not improved with higher testing rates as the signal becomes increasingly dominated by false positive test results (@fig-accuracy).

<fig-accuracy>

Introducing a lag in test result reporting necessarily decreases surveillance accuracy because an alert can only begin once the test results are in-hand, which increases the chance that an outbreak will end before results can be translated to an alert.
For the conditions simulated here, introducing a 14-day lag in test reporting for a perfect test reduces the surveillance accuracy by $approx$ 3%.
For all simulated scenarios, this is consistent with, or higher than, the accuracy achievable with an RDT-like imperfect test.
This always leads to an increase in the median delay from outbreak start to alert, relative to a perfect test with no result delays, as well as imperfect tests (@fig-delay).

<fig-delay>

It is notable that surveillance metrics do not change monotonically with an increase in testing rate, and this holds regardless of the type of test.
This effect is exaggerated for some metrics (detection delays, proportion of time in alert, and number of unavoidable cases) than others (accuracy).
In general, the increase in accuracy with higher testing rates is accompanied with longer testing delays.
This reflects the change from highly sensitive systems with low thresholds to more specific systems with higher thresholds at higher testing rates.
For Poisson noise, similar detection delays are observed for all test and noise magnitudes, with most of the variation attributable to the change in the testing rate (means of -3.7 to 36.1 days).
Under dynamical noise, there are clearer differences in the performance of perfect and imperfect diagnostic tests, with the separation of outcomes occurring later than observed for surveillance accuracy ($Lambda(8)$ vs $Lambda(2)$ #sym.dash.em @fig-delay and @fig-accuracy #sym.dash.em respectively).
With large amounts of dynamical noise ($Lambda(8)$), the mean detection delay of the 90% and 85% imperfect tests range from -17.5 days to 3.2 days, and from -25.2 days to -3.4 days, respectively.
Negative delays indicate that alerts are being triggered before the start of the outbreak and is correlated with the proportion of the time series that is under alert, with larger negative delays associated with more and/or longer alert periods (@fig-alert-proportion, @fig-alert-duration, @fig-num-alerts).
Long detection delays manifest as large numbers of unavoidable cases (i.e., cases that occur between the outbreak start and its detection) (@fig-unavoidable).
Given the exponential trajectory of infections in the initial phase of an outbreak, the pattern of unavoidable cases follows the same shape as for detection delays, but more exaggerated.

== Discussion

The performance of an outbreak detection system is highly sensitive to the structure and level of background noise in the simulation.
Despite the mean daily noise incidence set to equivalent values between the dynamical and Poisson-only simulations, drastically different results are observed.

Under the assumption that non-measles febrile rash is relatively static in time (Poisson noise scenarios), imperfect diagnostics can perform as well, if not better than perfect (ELISA-like) tests at moderate to high testing rates, and at a fraction of the cost @brownRapidDiagnosticTests2020.
However, if it is expected that the noise is dynamic, imperfect tests cannot overcome their accuracy limitations through higher testing rates, saturating at c. 74% accuracy, relative to 93% achieved with perfect tests.
This discrepancy occurs because, despite the same average incidence of noise in each (comparable) scenario, the relative proportion of measles to noise on any one day varies throughout the dynamical noise time series, exacerbating the effects of imperfect diagnostic tests that produce higher rates of false positives and negatives than perfect diagnostics.

For all noise structures and diagnostic tests, increasing testing rate was not accompanied by a monotonic change in the associated metrics.
The reason behind this unintuitive result stems from the use of integer-valued alert thresholds.
For a given diagnostic test, increasing the testing rate will result in an increase in the number of observed (test positive) cases.
This, however, may not translate to an integer increase in the moving average of test positive results, which is used to trigger an alert.
Even with a perfect test, the alert system must discriminate between endemic/imported cases and epidemic cases.
As such, the threshold may stay the same as the optimal value selected for the previous testing rate, providing an overly sensitive system that will be triggered more frequently by endemic cases.
Or, it can increase, resulting in a system with a higher PPV per alert, but lower surveillance sensitivity.
Both options may translate to a lower surveillance accuracy than observed when fewer individuals are tested.
But more importantly, this can result in contiguous testing rates selecting for system sensitivity vs PPV differently, translating to discontinuous changes in the outbreak delays (@fig-delay), unavoidable cases (@fig-unavoidable), and proportion of the time series in alert status (@fig-alert-proportion).

Surveillance is counting for action @DiseaseSurveillance.
What actions are taken depend upon the constraints imposed, and the values held, within a particular surveillance context.
This analysis is therefore not a complete optimization, which would require explicit decisions to be made about the preference for increased speed at the cost of higher false alert rates and lower PPV (and visa versa).
These will be country-specific decisions, and they may change throughout time; for example, favoring RDTs when there are low levels of background infections, and ELISAs during large (suspected) rubella outbreaks.
These trade-offs must be explicitly acknowledged when designing surveillance systems, and we present a framework to account for the deep interconnectedness of individual and population-level uncertainties that arise from necessary categorizations.

=== Limitations and Strengths
To our knowledge, this is one of the first simulation studies to examine the relationship between individual test characteristics and the wider surveillance program.
By explicitly modeling the interaction between the two, we make a case that surveillance systems should take a holistic approach; prematurely constraining one component can lead to drastically different, and suboptimal, results.
Additionally, by defining outbreak bounds concretely we have been able to calculate metrics of outbreak detection performance that draw parallels to those used when evaluating individual diagnostic tests.
This provides an intuitive understanding and simple implementation of this method in resource-constrained environments, something that may not be possible with many outbreak detection and early warning system simulations in the literature.
An evaluation of all outbreak detection algorithms is beyond the scope of this work, but a more computationally expensive approach based on nowcasting incidence may help overcome the shortcomings of imperfect diagnostics in high-noise scenarios.

For computational simplicity, this paper did not include demography in the model structure.
And while a simulation-based approach allows for complete determination of true infection status i.e., measles vs non-measles febrile rash cases, and therefore an accurate accounting of the outbreak and alert bounds, these simulations do not specifically represent any real-world setting.
The evaluation of empirical data does provide this opportunity, but at the cost of knowing the true infection status of individuals, confounding of multiple variables, limiting analysis to only those who are observed (i.e., not those in the community who do not visit a healthcare center), and removing the possibility to explore the sensitivity of the results to parameters of interest to a surveillance program e.g., testing rate, and the test itself.

Additionally, is has been well documented that the performance of an individual test is highly sensitive to its timing within a person’s infection cycle @gastanaduyMeasles2019 @larremoreTestSensitivitySecondary2021 @middletonModelingTransmissionMitigation2024 @kisslerViralDynamicsAcute2021 @ratnamPerformanceIndirectImmunoglobulin2000, so it is possible that different conclusions would be drawn if temporal information about the test administration was included in the simulation.

Finally, the optimal threshold for a testing scenario is affected by the use of integer-values; smaller steps could be chosen to potentially minimize discontinuities.
Similarly, the optimal threshold depends heavily on the costs ascribed to incorrect actions, be that failing to detect an outbreak or incorrectly mounting a response for an outbreak that doesn’t exist.
In the simulations we have weighted them equally, but it is likely that they should not be deemed equivalent; missing an outbreak may result in many thousands of cases, whereas an unnecessary alert would generally launch an initial low-cost investigation for full determination of the outbreak status.
This is particularly important in countries with vast heterogeneity in transmission: different weightings should be applied to higher vs. lower priority/risk regions to account for discrepancies in consequences of incorrect decisions.

Given these limitations, the explicit values (i.e., optimal thresholds, accuracies etc.) should be interpreted with caution, and the exact results observed in the real-world will likely be highly dependent on unseen factors, such as the proportion of measles and non-measles sources of febrile rash that seek healthcare.
However, the general patterns should hold, and more importantly, the analysis framework provides a consistent and holistic approach to evaluating the trade-off between individual level tests and the alert system enacted to detect outbreaks.
